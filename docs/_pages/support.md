# Support

If you think ShipsClock is not working as it should, I'd like to know about it.
Please:

- Be nice. This app is freely given.
- Read the [FAQ](faq.md) to see if that explains anything for you
- Check the [issue list](https://github.com/wbreeze/ShipsClock/issues)
  to see if any of those match the issue you are experiencing
- If there's something not covered by those,
  write to me using the email link below.

In your email,
- describe the behavior you are seeing and the behavior you are
  expecting. "I expected ___ but instead ___" or "I expected ___ because ___,
  but instead ___"
- let me know whether you want a reply
- understand that it could be a while, sometimes weeks, before
  you hear back or see any updates
- agree that any suggestions you provide are also freely given and don't
  make me beholden nor obligated to you in any way.
  That is, if you think that your idea should bring you fame and fortune,
  or that you would like to profit from it, don't tell me about it.

Thank you for telling me your thoughts.
