# FAQ

## Would you explain each part of the clock?

![clock face]({% link /assets/screenshot/face.jpeg %})

It is a twenty-four hour clock.
- the hour hand is the shortest, it goes around once per day.
- the minute hand is the longest, it goes around once per hour.
- the watch hand, that is the narrowest, goes around once every four hours.
- the sun and moon are shown in position relative to your meridian. When at
  noon they are as high in the sky as they will be for the day, at the noon
  meridian. What is shown is referred to in celestial navigation as the
  "local hour angle".
- the ticks every four hours correspond to the hour hand. They deliniate the
  beginnings and ends of four hour watch periods.
- the heavier ticks every six hours correspond to the watch hand. They
  deliniate the four hours of the watch.

For some examples, see [reading the clock face](face.md)

## What are the numbers?

The big bold numbers next to or below the clock face
display your current latitude, longitude, speed, and direction.
- the latitude, for example, N 24ยบ 17' 55" decodes as north latitude
  twenty-four degrees, seventeen minutes, fifty-five seconds.
- the longitude, for example, W 110ยบ 19' 54" decodes as west longitude
  one-hundred ten degrees, nineteen minutes, fifty-four seconds.
- the velocity, for example, 0.3 kts NW decodes as moving three tenths of a
  knot toward the northwest. The clock shows sixteen cardinal directions,
  for example, N, NNW, NW, WNW, W, ... and so forth.

## How do I tell time by the bells?

A ship's watch begins every four hours. Generally, we know what time it is
to the nearest four hours-- midnight, 4am, 8am, noon, 4pm, 8pm

The ship's bell rings every half hour. A double-ring counts one hour of
the watch.
A single ring at the end counts one half hour following the hour.

As an example, if we're just past mid-day and not into late afternoon, we know
that we're on the watch that began at noon.

- one single ring means it's 12:30pm
- one double ring means it's 1:00pm
- two double rings followed by a single ring means it's 2:30pm
- four double rings signify the end of the watch and
the beginning of the next. In this example, the time is now 4:00pm

## Why bells?

The bell is a simple and reliable means to tell time without looking at the
clock. We have Big Ben in London, a grandfather clock, or a cuckoo clock.
These ring up to twelve times to give the hour. The ship's bells are more
succinct given we generally know day or night, early morning or afternoon.

## Why does the app require notifications?

When the app is not displayed on your device, but nevertheless open, it can
play the bells for you using notifications. The app is not available to play
the bells directly when it is in this state.
The notifications method is the best allowed by the operating system.

## Will the silence switch silence the bells?

When the app is using notifications, yes. The silence switch will silence
the bells. When the app is actively displayed
on the screen of your phone it will play the bells regardless of the silence
switch setting.

## Can I keep my device from vibrating when the bells sound?

The vibration setting for notifications is currently a global setting for your
phone. The bells must be played as notifications when the app is not actively
displayed. Thus, the vibrations setting dictates whether your phone will
vibrate when the bells play.
